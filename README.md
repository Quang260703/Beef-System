Beef Revenue Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting gross revenue in beef production systems using various machine learning models. The goal is to build predictive models that can help optimize decision-making in beef supply chains by estimating revenue outcomes based on input features such as animal weight, feed costs, breed characteristics, market prices, and more.

ðŸ“Œ Features
